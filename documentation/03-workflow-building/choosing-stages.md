# Choosing Stages for Your Workflow

Not every project needs every stage. Learn how to choose the right stages for your situation.

## The Core Question

**What's at stake if this code fails?**

```
Low stakes → Fewer stages
High stakes → More stages
```

## The Risk-Based Approach

### Level 1: Throwaway Code (Minutes)

**Examples:**
- Learning exercises
- Quick experiments
- Temporary scripts
- Testing an idea

**Minimum stages:**
```
1. Build
2. Run it once
Done!
```

**Optional stages:**
- Planning (if unclear what to build)
- Testing (if you want to verify)

**Skip:**
- Documentation
- Review
- Deployment
- Everything else

**Example workflow:**
```
1. Have idea
2. Open editor
3. Code for 10 minutes
4. Run it
5. See results
6. Delete or keep
```

### Level 2: Personal Projects (Hours-Days)

**Examples:**
- Side projects
- Portfolio pieces
- Small tools for yourself
- Learning projects

**Minimum stages:**
```
1. Planning (quick - 5 min)
2. Building
3. Testing (manual is fine)
```

**Consider adding:**
- Documentation (future-you will thank you)
- Version control (git commits)
- Error handling

**Can skip:**
- Formal review
- Comprehensive testing
- Production deployment

**Example workflow:**
```
1. Write down Three Questions
2. Code the feature
3. Test manually
4. Fix obvious bugs
5. Commit to git
6. Move to next feature
```

### Level 3: Shared Projects (Days-Weeks)

**Examples:**
- Team projects
- Open source contributions
- Projects others will use
- Your startup MVP

**Recommended stages:**
```
1. Planning (document requirements)
2. Building (with version control)
3. Testing (automated tests)
4. Review (self or peer)
5. Deployment (to staging/production)
```

**Don't skip:**
- Planning (team needs alignment)
- Testing (others depend on it working)
- Review (catch issues early)

**Optional:**
- Security audit (if not handling sensitive data)
- Performance testing (if not many users)

**Example workflow:**
```
1. Write user stories or requirements
2. Break into tasks
3. Build feature with tests
4. Self-review
5. Create pull request
6. Address feedback
7. Merge and deploy
```

### Level 4: Production Systems (Weeks-Months)

**Examples:**
- Client projects
- Production applications
- Systems with users
- Revenue-generating products

**Required stages:**
```
1. Design (architecture)
2. Planning (detailed requirements)
3. Building (with best practices)
4. Testing (comprehensive)
5. Review (multiple reviewers)
6. Security audit
7. Deployment (with rollback plan)
8. Monitoring
```

**Never skip:**
- Planning (requirements prevent rework)
- Testing (bugs cost users and money)
- Review (quality matters)
- Security (breaches are expensive)
- Monitoring (need to know when things break)

**Example workflow:**
```
1. Gather requirements from stakeholders
2. Design architecture and database
3. Plan sprint/milestone
4. Build with TDD
5. Write integration tests
6. Self-review
7. AI code review
8. Peer review
9. Security scan
10. Deploy to staging
11. QA testing
12. Deploy to production
13. Monitor metrics
```

```

## Decision Framework

### Step 1: Assess Your Project

Answer these questions:

```markdown
1. Who will use this? (Just me / Team / Public)
2. What if it breaks? (No problem / Inconvenient / Serious issue)
3. Does it handle sensitive data? (No / Yes)
4. How long will it be used? (Once / Months / Years)
5. How complex is it? (< 100 lines / < 1000 lines / > 1000 lines)
6. How often will it change? (Once / Sometimes / Frequently)
```

### Step 2: Apply the Rules

**If mostly "low risk" answers:**
```
→ Use Level 1 or 2 workflow
→ Minimum stages
→ Focus on speed and learning
```

**If mixed answers:**
```
→ Use Level 3 workflow
→ Standard stages
→ Balance speed and quality
```

**If mostly "high risk" answers:**
```
→ Use Level 4 workflow
→ All stages
→ Focus on quality and reliability
```

### Step 3: Customize

Start with the recommended level, then:

**Add stages if:**
- You keep finding bugs after deployment
- Security is more important than you thought
- More people are using it than expected
- Compliance requirements change

**Remove stages if:**
- They're not adding value
- Simpler process works fine
- You're moving too slowly
- The project is simpler than expected

## Stage Efficiency Tips

### Making Planning Faster

**Instead of:**
```
Writing 10-page requirements document
Creating detailed diagrams
Planning every edge case
```

**Try:**
```
Answer Three Questions (2 min)
Sketch main flow on paper (5 min)
List must-have features (5 min)
```

### Making Testing Faster

**Instead of:**
```
Writing tests for every line
100% code coverage
Every possible edge case
```

**Try:**
```
Test happy path
Test one edge case per feature
Test what breaks in production
```

### Making Review Faster

**Instead of:**
```
Scheduling formal review meeting
Waiting for team review
Comprehensive audit
```

**Try:**
```
Quick self-review checklist
AI review in 2 minutes
Peer review async in PR
```

## When to Add Stages

### Start Minimal, Add When Needed

**Add Security when:**
- Handling user passwords
- Processing payments
- Storing personal data
- Getting security questions from users

**Add Performance Testing when:**
- Users complain about speed
- You expect traffic spikes
- You're adding caching
- Database queries are slow

**Add Documentation when:**
- New team members join
- You forget how your own code works
- Others will use your API
- It's been more than a month

**Add Monitoring when:**
- You have users in production
- You need to know when things break
- You want to understand usage
- You're making money from this

## Quick Decision Guide

```
Are you learning? → Minimal stages
Is it just for you? → Few stages
Will others use it? → Standard stages
Is money involved? → All stages
Is data sensitive? → All stages + security
Could it harm users if broken? → All stages + extra review
```

## Common Questions

### "Can I skip testing?"

**For throwaway code:** Yes
**For anything else:** Not recommended
**Minimum:** Test that it works once
**Better:** Test happy path + one edge case

### "Do I always need review?"

**For solo personal projects:** Optional
**For team projects:** Recommended
**For production:** Required
**Alternative:** AI review is better than no review

### "Is planning really necessary?"

**For tiny scripts:** Can skip
**For everything else:** At least answer Three Questions
**Benefit:** 5 minutes planning saves 30 minutes debugging

### "What if I'm not sure?"

**Start minimal:** Use fewer stages
**Add as needed:** If you find bugs, add testing
**Observe pain points:** Add stages that would have prevented them
**Iterate:** Workflows evolve with experience
