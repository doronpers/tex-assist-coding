## Part 2: Calculate Your Workflow Level

Based on your answers, determine your workflow level:

### Scoring Guide

Count your "high complexity" answers:

**High complexity if:**
- Experience: Beginner or Novice
- Project type: Professional, Client, or Startup
- Users: 100+
- Data: Sensitive or Regulated
- Complexity: Large or Distributed
- Concerns: Security, Users, Maintainability

**Total high complexity answers:** _____ / 8

**Your workflow level:**
- 0-2 points: **MINIMAL** workflow
- 3-4 points: **BALANCED** workflow
- 5-6 points: **COMPREHENSIVE** workflow
- 7-8 points: **ENTERPRISE** workflow

## Using Your Workflow

### Week 1: Try It

Use your workflow for one complete project or feature.

**Track:**
- What worked well?
- What felt unnecessary?
- What was missing?
- How long did each stage take?

### Week 2-4: Refine

Make ONE adjustment based on your experience.

**Don't:**
- Change everything at once
- Give up because it's not perfect
- Copy someone else's workflow

**Do:**
- Make small improvements
- Trust your experience
- Keep what works

### Month 2-3: Establish

Your workflow should feel natural now.

**Signs it's working:**
- You follow it without thinking
- You finish projects confidently
- Bugs are caught early
- Code is maintainable

### Month 6+: Evolve

Revisit your workflow assessment.

**Questions:**
- Have your needs changed?
- Are you more experienced?
- Have stakes increased?
- Is it time to evolve?

## Common Workflow Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Using someone else's workflow**
→ Build yours based on YOUR needs

**Mistake 2: Never adjusting**
→ Evolve as you grow

**Mistake 3: Too complex too soon**
→ Start simple, add later

**Mistake 4: Skipping stages that matter**
→ If you keep hitting problems, add a stage

**Mistake 5: Following it religiously**
→ Adapt to context, it's a guide not a law
