# GitHub Basics

Welcome! If you're new to GitHub, you're in the right place. This section will help you understand what GitHub is, why it matters, and how to use it confidently.

## What You'll Learn Here

- What GitHub actually is (and why developers love it)
- How to navigate repositories without fear
- Understanding branches, commits, and pull requests
- Working with others safely
- Recovering when things go wrong

## Why GitHub Matters

Think of GitHub as:
- **Google Docs for code** - Multiple people can work together
- **Time machine** - See any previous version of your code
- **Portfolio** - Show off what you've built
- **Community** - Learn from millions of open source projects

## No Timeline, YOUR Timeline - Dark Horse Approach

**🐴 Your learning path is unique.**

**Standardized thinking:** "Everyone should master GitHub in X weeks"

**Dark Horse thinking:** "I'll learn GitHub in whatever way and timeframe works for MY brain and MY needs"

Everyone learns GitHub differently:
- Some people understand it in an afternoon → That's one path
- Some people take weeks to feel comfortable → That's another path
- Some people return to these docs for years → That's another valid path
- **Your pace is YOUR pace** - compare only to your past self

**Consider your micro-motives:**
- If you love understanding systems → Deep dive into Git internals
- If you love practical tools → Just learn what you need for your project
- If you love visual thinking → Use GitHub Desktop or GitKraken
- If you love command line → Master git commands
- If you love collaboration → Focus on PRs and issues
- If you work solo → Basic commit/push might be enough

**Permission: Learn GitHub YOUR way. Skip what doesn't serve you right now.**

## Where to Start - YOUR Choice

**🐴 No prescribed order.** Start wherever interests you or serves your current need.

### Never Used GitHub Before?
**Try:** **[First 10 Minutes](first-10-minutes.md)** - Just click around and explore
**Why:** Hands-on discovery, no consequences
**But:** If exploration without context frustrates you, start with concepts below instead

### Want to Understand the Concepts First?
**Try:** **[Understanding Repositories](understanding-repositories.md)** - Theory before practice
**Why:** Build mental model before doing
**But:** If conceptual learning bores you, jump into First 10 Minutes instead

### Ready to Do Something?
**Try:** **[Branches and Commits](branches-and-commits.md)** - Make your first change
**Why:** Learn by doing
**But:** If you need more context first, start with Understanding Repositories

### Working with Others?
**Try:** **[Pull Requests Explained](pull-requests-explained.md)** - Collaboration workflow
**Why:** Solve immediate need
**But:** You might want branches/commits foundation first (or maybe not!)

**Trust your gut. Your micro-motives will guide you to the right starting point.**

## Feeling Stuck?

**If GitHub feels overwhelming:**
- Remember: EVERYONE finds it confusing at first
- GitHub has been around since 2008 and has accumulated a lot of features
- You only need to understand a tiny fraction to be productive
- Ask AI: "Explain GitHub like I'm 5 years old"

**If you make a mistake:**
- That's literally what Git was designed for - fixing mistakes
- Almost everything is reversible
- See [When Things Break](when-things-break.md) for recovery strategies

**Still confused after reading?**
- Try it anyway - clicking around won't break anything
- Come back and re-read after trying
- Ask a human (no shame!)
- Open an issue in this repo

## You Might Be Ready for [AI Tools](../02-ai-tools/README.md) When...

- [ ] You understand what a repository is
- [ ] You've made a commit or two
- [ ] You're curious about coding with AI help

Not there yet? Perfect! No timeline. Stay here as long as you need.
