# Comparing AI Coding Tools

Different tools for different tasks. Let's figure out what works for YOU.

## 🐴 Dark Horse Note

**There's no "best" tool - only the best tool FOR YOU right now.**

**Your optimal choice depends on:**
- Your micro-motives (what energizes you?)
- Your workflow style (integrated vs. separate?)
- Your learning style (doing vs. understanding first?)
- Your budget (free vs. paid?)
- Your project context (quick experiment vs. production?)

**Permission: Start with one tool. Add more only if they serve you. Drop tools that don't fit.**

**Ignore "everyone uses X" - use what works for YOUR brain and workflow.**

## Combining Tools

### The Power Combo

**Best practice:** Use multiple tools together!

#### Workflow Example: Building a Feature

**Step 1: Design (Claude)**
```
Claude: "I need to add user authentication.
What architecture should I use?"

→ Get thorough architecture advice
```

**Step 2: Generate Structure (ChatGPT)**
```
ChatGPT: "Create the basic FastAPI endpoint structure
for user registration and login"

→ Get initial code structure
```

**Step 3: Implement (Copilot)**
```
In VS Code: Add comments, let Copilot autocomplete
→ Fast implementation of details
```

**Step 4: Review (Claude)**
```
Claude: "Review this authentication code for
security vulnerabilities"

→ Get security feedback
```

**Step 5: Debug (ChatGPT)**
```
ChatGPT: "This is throwing an error: [error]
Here's the code: [code]"

→ Quick debugging help
```

### Workflow Example: Learning

**Understanding:**
```
ChatGPT: "Explain async/await in Python"
→ Learn the concept
```

**Practice:**
```
Copilot: Write async functions with suggestions
→ Practice implementation
```

**Review:**
```
Claude: "Is my async code following best practices?"
→ Get feedback
```
