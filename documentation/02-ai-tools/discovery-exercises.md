# Discovery Exercises: Finding Your AI Tools

Hands-on exercises to discover which AI tools work best for you. No right answers - just exploration!

## The Goal

By the end of these exercises, you'll:
- Have tried multiple AI tools
- Understand your preferences
- Know when to use which tool
- Feel confident experimenting

## Exercise 1: The Same Question, Three Ways

**Time:** 15-20 minutes

**Task:** Ask the same coding question to three different AI tools.

### The Question

Pick one of these (or create your own):

**Option A:**
```
Explain how to read a CSV file in Python and convert it to a list of dictionaries.
Include example code and explain each step.
```

**Option B:**
```
I'm getting this error: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'"
How do I fix it?
```

**Option C:**
```
What's the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
When should I use each one?
```

### Try These Tools

1. **ChatGPT** (free version)
   - Go to chat.openai.com
   - Ask your question
   - Note the response

2. **Claude** (free version)
   - Go to claude.ai
   - Ask the same question
   - Note the response

3. **GitHub Copilot** (if you have it)
   - Open VS Code
   - Create a Python file
   - Write the question as a comment
   - See what Copilot suggests

### Reflection

After trying all three, answer:

- Which response did you understand best?
- Which was most helpful?
- Which format did you prefer?
- Any surprising differences?

**There's no "right" answer!** Your preference matters most.

## Exercise 2: Code Generation Comparison

**Time:** 20-30 minutes

**Task:** Generate the same piece of code with different tools.

### The Code

Create a Python function that:
- Accepts a list of numbers
- Returns only the even numbers
- Returns them sorted in descending order

### Method 1: Chat-Based (ChatGPT or Claude)

**Prompt:**
```
Create a Python function that:
- Accepts a list of numbers
- Returns only the even numbers
- Returns them sorted in descending order

Include type hints and a docstring.
```

Copy the code to a file.

### Method 2: Inline (GitHub Copilot)

**In VS Code:**
```python
def filter_and_sort_evens(numbers):
    """
    Filter even numbers and sort them in descending order.

    Args:
        numbers: List of integers

    Returns:
        List of even integers sorted descending
    """
    # Let Copilot complete this
```

### Method 3: Iteration with Chat

**Start simple:**
```
Create a function to filter even numbers from a list
```

**Then refine:**
```
Now modify it to also sort them descending
```

**Then polish:**
```
Add type hints and a docstring
```

### Test All Versions

```python
# Test each version
test_data = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 4, 7, 6, 3]
result = filter_and_sort_evens(test_data)
print(result)  # Should be [8, 6, 4, 2]
```

### Reflection

- Which method was fastest?
- Which gave the best code?
- Which felt most natural to you?
- Which would you use for real work?

## Exercise 3: Debugging Practice

**Time:** 15-20 minutes

**Task:** Use AI to debug broken code.

### The Broken Code

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)

# Test it
scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]
print(calculate_average(scores))  # Works!

empty_scores = []
print(calculate_average(empty_scores))  # Crashes!
```

### Try Different Approaches

**Approach 1: Direct Question to Chat AI**
```
This code crashes when given an empty list:
[paste code]
How do I fix it?
```

**Approach 2: Copilot Comment**
```python
# TODO: Fix this function to handle empty lists
def calculate_average(numbers):
    # Let Copilot suggest fixes
```

**Approach 3: Ask for Explanation First**
```
This code crashes with "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero"
Explain why this happens and suggest a fix:
[paste code]
```

### Reflection

- Which approach helped you learn more?
- Did you understand the fixes?
- Which would you use when stuck?

## Exercise 4: Learning a Concept

**Time:** 20-30 minutes

**Task:** Learn something new using AI.

### Pick a Topic

Choose something you don't know well:
- List comprehensions in Python
- Async/await in JavaScript
- SQL JOINs
- React hooks
- Git rebase
- [Your choice]

### Try Different Learning Styles

**Style 1: Ask for Simple Explanation**
```
Explain [topic] like I'm a beginner.
Use a real-world analogy.
```

**Style 2: Request Progression**
```
Teach me [topic] in this order:
1. Simple example
2. Why it's useful
3. Common mistakes
4. Practice exercise
```

**Style 3: Interactive Learning**
```
I want to learn [topic].
Can you give me a challenge to solve,
then explain the solution?
```

### Reflection

- Which style helped you learn best?
- Did you actually understand the concept?
- Could you explain it to someone else?
- Which AI was the best teacher for you?

## Exercise 5: Code Review

**Time:** 15-20 minutes

**Task:** Get AI to review code.

### The Code to Review

```python
def process_users(users):
    result = []
    for user in users:
        if user["age"] >= 18:
            result.append(user["name"])
    return result
```

### Different Review Approaches

**Approach 1: General Review**
```
Review this Python code for potential issues:
[paste code]
```

**Approach 2: Specific Focus**
```
Review this code specifically for:
1. Potential bugs
2. Readability issues
3. Pythonic improvements

[paste code]
```

**Approach 3: Security Review**
```
Review this code for security issues
and edge cases that could cause crashes:
[paste code]
```

### Compare Results

- Which review was most helpful?
- Did different AIs catch different issues?
- Which feedback did you actually apply?

### Reflection

- Would you use AI for code reviews?
- Which AI gave the best feedback?
- What kind of reviews are most useful to you?

**Option B: Number Guessing Game**
- Computer picks random number 1-100
- User guesses
- Give "higher" or "lower" hints
- Count number of guesses

**Option C: Simple Calculator**
- Add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Handle errors gracefully
- Keep running until user quits

### Build It Your Way

Use whatever combination of AI tools feels right:
- Plan with ChatGPT/Claude
- Implement with Copilot
- Debug with Chat AI
- Review with Claude

### Track Your Process

Note:
- Which tools you used for what

## Exercise 7: Prompt Iteration

**Time:** 20-30 minutes

**Task:** Practice improving prompts.

### Start Vague, Get Specific

**Iteration 1:**
```
Create a login function
```

Note the response.

**Iteration 2:**
```
Create a Python login function that accepts username and password
```

Note how it improved.

**Iteration 3:**
```
Create a Python login function that:
- Accepts username and password
- Checks against a database
- Returns a JWT token if valid
- Returns an error message if invalid
```

Note the improvement.

**Iteration 4:**
```
Create a Python FastAPI login endpoint that:
- Accepts username and password via POST
- Validates against PostgreSQL database
- Returns JWT token (1 hour expiry) if valid
- Returns 401 status with error message if invalid
- Includes error handling for database failures
- Uses password hashing (bcrypt)
- Includes rate limiting (5 attempts per minute)

Include type hints, docstrings, and example usage.
```

### Reflection

- How did responses improve?
- At what point was it "good enough"?
- How specific should you be?
- When is too much detail overwhelming?

```

### Review the Response

Check for:
- [ ] Does it actually validate URLs?
- [ ] Does it handle edge cases?
- [ ] Is the regex correct?
- [ ] What about localhost URLs?
- [ ] What about IP addresses?
