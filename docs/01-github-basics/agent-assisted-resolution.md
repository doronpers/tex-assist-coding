## How to Use AI Agents for Git Problems

### Method 1: GitHub Copilot with Repository Context

**Setup:**
1. Open your repository in VS Code
2. Enable GitHub Copilot
3. Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl/Cmd + I or sidebar icon)

**Example interaction:**
```
You: I have a merge conflict in src/app.py. Can you help me understand what's happening?

Copilot: [Analyzes the conflict markers]
I see there's a conflict between:
- Your branch: Added error handling
- Main branch: Refactored the function signature

Both changes are valuable. Here's how to keep both:
[Shows combined version]

You: What if I apply this incorrectly?

Copilot: No worries! Since you haven't committed yet, you can always:
git checkout src/app.py   # Reset the file
Let's do it step by step...
```

### Method 2: Web-Based GitHub Copilot

**When to use:** Complex multi-file changes or planning

**Access:**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub.com
2. Click the Copilot icon (if available)
3. Describe your situation

**Example scenario:**
```
Situation: I need to resolve conflicts in 5 files after merging main into my feature branch.

Agent helps by:
1. Analyzing all conflicts together
2. Showing which conflicts are related
3. Suggesting resolution order (do database.py first, then app.py, etc.)
4. Explaining why certain changes conflict
5. Validating your resolutions
```

### Method 3: Screen-Sharing with AI Chat Tools

**For Claude or ChatGPT when they support it:**

**Steps:**
1. Share your screen showing:
   - Git status output
   - Conflict markers in files
   - Your repository structure

2. Walk through the problem:
```
You: Here's my git status [shares screen]
     I'm confused about these conflicts.

AI: I can see you have conflicts in 3 files. 
    Let's tackle them one by one. 
    Start with models.py - that looks straightforward...
```

### Method 4: Paste Repository State

**When screen sharing isn't available:**

**Gather information:**
```bash
# Get comprehensive state
git status > git-state.txt
git log --oneline --graph --all -20 >> git-state.txt
git diff --name-only main...your-branch >> git-state.txt

# For conflicts
git diff --check >> git-state.txt
```

**Share with AI:**
```
You: I'm stuck with merge conflicts. Here's my state:
     [Paste contents of git-state.txt]
     
     And here's the conflict in app.py:
     [Paste conflict section]

AI: I can help! Based on your history, here's what happened...
```

## Step-by-Step: Using AI for Merge Conflict Resolution

### Phase 1: Understanding

**Ask the AI agent:**
```
"I have merge conflicts after running git merge main. 
Can you help me understand what's happening?"

Share:
- Output of `git status`
- Output of `git log --oneline --graph -10`
- The specific conflicts (files with <<<<<<< markers)
```

**Agent will explain:**
- Why the conflict happened
- What each side of the conflict is trying to do
- Which changes are yours vs. incoming
- Safe ways to proceed

### Phase 2: Planning Resolution

**Ask the AI agent:**
```
"What's the safest way to resolve these conflicts?"
```

**Agent provides:**
- Resolution strategy (which files first)
- What to keep in each conflict
- How to test after each resolution
- Backup steps before proceeding

### Phase 3: Guided Resolution

**Work with the agent interactively:**

```
You: Starting with models.py. Here's the conflict:
     <<<<<<< HEAD
     def get_user(id: int):
     =======
     def get_user(user_id: str):
     >>>>>>> main

Agent: This is a function signature change. The incoming change uses 
       user_id (more descriptive) and str type (more flexible).
       
       Let's combine the improvements:
       def get_user(user_id: int):
       
       This keeps the descriptive name but maintains int type for 
       backward compatibility. Does that match your usage?

You: Yes! What about the function body?

Agent: Let me see that...
```

### Phase 4: Verification

**Ask the agent:**
```
"I've resolved all conflicts. How do I verify everything works?"
```

**Agent guides you:**
```bash
# 1. Check no conflict markers remain
git diff --check

# 2. Verify files compile/run
python app.py
# or
npm test

# 3. Review what you're committing
git diff --staged

# 4. Commit if everything looks good
git commit -m "Merge main into feature/auth - resolved conflicts"
```

## Advanced: Using Agents for Complex Recovery

### Scenario: Lost Commits

**What happened:**
```
You ran git reset --hard by accident and lost commits.
You're panicking.
```

**Using AI agent:**
```
You: HELP! I ran git reset --hard and lost my work!

Agent: Don't panic! Git rarely loses things. Let's use reflog:

      Run: git reflog
      
      Look for your commits (they'll have your commit messages).
      Find the commit hash before the reset.
      
You: I see it! a3f2b9c - "Add authentication feature"

Agent: Perfect! Let's recover:
      
      git checkout a3f2b9c
      
      You're now at that commit. Let's create a branch:
      
      git checkout -b recovered-auth-feature
      
      Your work is recovered! Now let's understand what happened
      so we prevent this in the future...
```

### Scenario: Rebase Gone Wrong

**What happened:**
```
Interactive rebase created a mess.
Conflicts you don't understand.
Want to abort but not sure how.
```

**Using AI agent:**
```
You: My rebase is totally messed up. How do I get out safely?

Agent: Easy! Run: git rebase --abort
      
      This returns you to before the rebase started.
      Nothing is lost.
      
You: Okay, I'm back. But I still need to clean up my commits...

Agent: Let's approach this differently. Can you show me:
      1. What commits you want to keep
      2. What you're trying to achieve
      
      We can plan a safer approach together.
```

## Safety Best Practices with AI Agents

### Before Taking AI Advice

**1. Understand the suggestion**
```
Don't blindly copy-paste commands.

Instead:
You: What does 'git reset --hard' do?
AI: It discards all changes and moves HEAD. 
    CAUTION: This deletes uncommitted work!
```

**2. Create backups for destructive operations**
```
Before any reset, force-push, or rebase:

git branch backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

Now you have a safety copy.
```

**3. Ask "What if I mess this up?"**
```
You: If I apply this fix and it breaks, how do I undo?

Agent provides rollback strategy before you proceed.
```

### During Resolution

**Check your work frequently:**
```bash
# After each file resolution
git status
git diff

# After completing all resolutions  
git diff --check  # Finds conflict markers
```

**Ask for validation:**
```
You: I've resolved the conflicts. Can you review my approach?

[Paste your resolutions]

Agent: Checks for common mistakes:
- Leftover conflict markers
- Broken code syntax
- Logic errors from merging
```

### After Resolution

**Before committing:**
```
You: I'm about to commit. Any last checks?

Agent: Yes!
1. Run tests if you have them
2. Check git diff --staged 
3. Make sure commit message describes what you resolved
4. Consider if any documentation needs updating
```

## When to Call for Human Help

AI agents are powerful, but know when to escalate:

### Call a human when:
- **Data loss risk** - You're about to delete important work
- **Shared branch issues** - Others are working on same code
- **Production emergencies** - Live system is affected
- **Legal/compliance concerns** - License or security implications
- **Agent seems confused** - Contradictory suggestions
- **You don't understand** - After asking AI to clarify multiple times

### How to escalate:
1. **Document what you tried**
   - Commands you ran
   - Error messages
   - What AI suggested
   
2. **Take a screenshot** of your current state

3. **Don't try more things** - Stop before making it worse

4. **Ask team/mentor**: "I'm stuck on X. I tried Y. AI suggested Z. Need help."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Trusting AI Blindly

**Problem:**
```
You: [Complex conflict]
AI: Just delete all of theirs and keep yours.
You: [Deletes without reviewing]
```

**Better approach:**
```
You: [Complex conflict]
AI: Consider keeping yours because...
You: Wait, why would we keep ours? What does theirs do?
AI: Good question! Let me explain both approaches...
```

### Mistake 2: Not Creating Backups

**Problem:**
```
AI: Try git reset --hard
You: [Runs command, loses work]
```

**Better approach:**
```
AI: Try git reset --hard
You: Before I do that, let me backup:
     git branch backup-just-in-case
     [Now safe to try suggestion]
```

### Mistake 3: Skipping Verification

**Problem:**
```
[Resolves conflicts]
git commit
git push
[Build breaks]
```

**Better approach:**
```
[Resolves conflicts]
# Run tests
npm test  # or python -m pytest

# Check it works
npm start

# THEN commit
git commit
git push
```

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Database Migration Conflict

**Situation:**
```
Two branches both modified database schema.
Conflict in migrations file.
Unsure which migration number to use.
```

**Using AI agent:**
```
You: I have a conflict in migrations. Both branches created 
     migration_003.sql. Which number should I use?

Agent: This is a common issue. You need to:
       1. Rename one to migration_004.sql
       2. Update any references to the migration number
       3. Run migrations in order to test
       
       Let's check which migration was created first by looking
       at the timestamps...
       
You: Branch A was merged first.

Agent: Then keep Branch A as _003, rename yours to _004.
       This preserves the order. Here's how...
```

### Example 2: Accidental Force Push

**Situation:**
```
Force pushed to shared branch.
Teammates can't push anymore.
Need to restore without losing anyone's work.
```

**Using AI agent:**
```
You: I force pushed to develop by accident. Team is blocked.
     How do I fix this?

Agent: Let's recover the old state:
       
       1. Ask team to push their branches if they haven't
       2. Get the commit hash before your force push:
          git reflog origin/develop
       3. Reset develop to that point:
          git reset --hard <old-commit>
          git push --force-with-lease
       
       But first, let's make sure we don't lose your changes...
       Create a feature branch for your work:
       git branch my-work-saved
       
       Now let's restore develop safely...
```

### Example 3: Cherry-Pick Multiple Commits

**Situation:**
```
Need to port specific commits from feature branch to hotfix.
Many commits, some depend on others.
Don't want to merge entire branch.
```

**Using AI agent:**
```
You: I need commits A, D, and F from feature branch, but not
     the others. How do I cherry-pick safely?

Agent: Let's check dependencies first:
       
       git log feature-branch --oneline
       
       [Reviews output]
       
       I see commit D depends on commit C (they modify same file).
       You'll need C, D, and F.
       
       Safe order:
       git cherry-pick <C-hash>
       # Test it works
       git cherry-pick <D-hash>
       # Test it works
       git cherry-pick <F-hash>
       # Final test
       
       If any fail, we'll resolve conflicts one at a time.
```
