# GitHub Basics

Welcome! If you're new to GitHub, you're in the right place. This section will help you understand what GitHub is, why it matters, and how to use it confidently.

## What You'll Learn Here

- What GitHub actually is (and why developers love it)
- How to navigate repositories without fear
- Understanding branches, commits, and pull requests
- Working with others safely
- Recovering when things go wrong

## Why GitHub Matters

Think of GitHub as:
- **Google Docs for code** - Multiple people can work together
- **Time machine** - See any previous version of your code
- **Portfolio** - Show off what you've built
- **Community** - Learn from millions of open source projects

## No Timeline, No Pressure

Everyone learns GitHub at their own pace:
- Some people understand it in an afternoon
- Some people take weeks to feel comfortable
- Some people return to these docs for years

**All of these are completely normal.**

## Where to Start

### Never Used GitHub Before?
Start with **[First 10 Minutes](first-10-minutes.md)** - Just click around and explore. No consequences, no mistakes.

### Want to Understand the Concepts?
Start with **[Understanding Repositories](understanding-repositories.md)** - What repos actually are and how they work.

### Ready to Try Something?
Start with **[Branches and Commits](branches-and-commits.md)** - Make your first change safely.

### Working with Others?
Start with **[Pull Requests Explained](pull-requests-explained.md)** - How to collaborate without stepping on toes.

7. **[When Things Break](when-things-break.md)** - Recovery strategies

## Feeling Stuck?

**If GitHub feels overwhelming:**
- Remember: EVERYONE finds it confusing at first
- GitHub has been around since 2008 and has accumulated a lot of features
- You only need to understand a tiny fraction to be productive
- Ask AI: "Explain GitHub like I'm 5 years old"

**If you make a mistake:**
- That's literally what Git was designed for - fixing mistakes
- Almost everything is reversible
- See [When Things Break](when-things-break.md) for recovery strategies

**Still confused after reading?**
- Try it anyway - clicking around won't break anything
- Come back and re-read after trying
- Ask a human (no shame!)
- Open an issue in this repo

## You Might Be Ready for [AI Tools](../02-ai-tools/README.md) When...

- [ ] You understand what a repository is
- [ ] You've made a commit or two
- [ ] You're curious about coding with AI help

Not there yet? Perfect! No timeline. Stay here as long as you need.
