# Your First 10 Minutes on GitHub

Welcome! Let's explore GitHub together with absolutely zero pressure. You're just clicking around, and that's perfect.

## The Goal

By the end of this guide, you'll:
- Feel comfortable navigating GitHub
- Understand what you're looking at
- Not be intimidated by the interface

That's it. No coding, no complicated commands, just exploration.

## Ground Rules

1. **You can't break anything by looking**
2. **There are no stupid questions**
3. **Take as long as you need**
4. **Skip parts that bore you**

Ready? Let's go!

## Minute 1-2: Visit This Repository

You're probably already here, but let's look around:

1. **Look at the URL**
   ```
   github.com/doronpers/tex-assist-coding
   ```
   Format: `github.com/[owner]/[repository-name]`

2. **See the tabs at the top?**
   - `<> Code` - The files
   - `Issues` - Bug reports and discussions
   - `Pull requests` - Proposed changes
   - `Actions` - Automated tasks
   - More...

3. **Notice the file list**
   - It's like a folder view in Finder/Explorer
   - You can click any file to read it
   - You can click folders to go inside

## Minute 3-4: Explore a File

1. **Click on `README.md`** (if you're not already viewing it)
2. **Notice:**
   - The file content is formatted nicely
   - Line numbers on the left
   - A "Raw" button (shows unformatted text)
   - A "Blame" button (who changed each line)
   - A "History" button (all versions of this file)

3. **Click "History"**
   - See every time this file was changed
   - Click any commit to see what changed
   - Green = added, Red = removed

**Observation:** Every change is tracked. Forever. Mind = blown? 🤯

## Minute 5-6: Browse a Popular Repository

Let's visit a famous open source project:

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/microsoft/vscode
   (Visual Studio Code - the code editor)

2. **Notice:**
   - ⭐ Stars (397k+!) - Like YouTube likes
   - 👁️ Watching - People following updates
   - 🔱 Forks (97k+!) - Copies people made
   - These numbers show popularity

3. **Scroll down**
   - See the README explaining what VS Code is
   - It's like the "About" page

4. **Click "Issues"**
   - See what bugs people reported
   - Some are closed (fixed), some are open
   - Anyone can report issues!

5. **Click "Pull requests"**
   - See proposed changes from contributors
   - Some from Microsoft employees, some from community
   - Open source in action!

**Observation:** Thousands of people collaborate on this project. GitHub makes it possible.

## Minute 7-8: Explore Code

Let's look at actual code:

1. **In the VS Code repo, click "src/"** (source code folder)
2. **Click "vs/"**
3. **Click any `.ts` file** (TypeScript)
4. **Notice:**
   - Syntax highlighting (colors for code)
   - You can read it like a document
   - Comments explaining what it does

5. **Click a line number** (like line 47)
   - The URL updates with `#L47`
   - Share this URL to point someone to a specific line!
   - Try it: Copy the URL and paste it in a new tab

**Observation:** Code is just text files. You can read it!

## Minute 9: Check Out Issues

Issues are like a project's to-do list:

1. **Still in the VS Code repo, click "Issues"**
2. **Click on an interesting issue title**
3. **Read the description**
   - Someone describes a problem
   - Others discuss solutions
   - Links to related issues
   - Maybe someone fixes it!

4. **Scroll through comments**
   - See how people collaborate
   - Notice the friendly tone (usually)
   - See tags like `bug`, `feature-request`

**Observation:** Issues are conversations. GitHub is social!

## Minute 10: Create Your Own Repository

Let's make you a repo! (Don't worry, it's free and easy)

1. **Click the "+" icon** (top right of GitHub)
2. **Select "New repository"**
3. **Fill in:**
   - Repository name: `my-first-repo` (or anything)
   - Description: "Learning GitHub!"
   - Public or Private: Your choice
   - ✅ Check "Add a README file"
4. **Click "Create repository"**

🎉 **Congratulations! You own a repository!**

### Now What?

You're looking at YOUR repo. You can:
- Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
- Type a filename: `hello.txt`
- Write something: "Hello, GitHub!"
- Scroll down, click "Commit new file"

You just made your first commit! 🎊

   - Go to any repo → Click "commits"
   - Scroll to the bottom → Click "Oldest"

2. **A closed Pull Request**
   - Any repo → Pull Requests → Filters → Closed
   - See how the conversation unfolded

3. **Someone's profile**

   - See green squares showing your activity
   - Make commits to fill in the squares!

## Common Reactions

### "This seems complicated"
It is at first! But you're already navigating better than you were 10 minutes ago. Every developer started here.

### "What's all this technical stuff?"
You don't need to understand it all now. Focus on:
- Files and folders (you know these)
- README (it's just a document)
- Issues (they're like emails)

### "I don't know what I'm looking at"
That's okay! Pick a repo about something you know (like a game you play) and explore. Context helps.

### "I'm ready for more!"
Great! Try the exercises or build an example project. You've got the basics down.

## Feeling Stuck?

**If GitHub still feels overwhelming:**
- You just learned more than you realize
- Come back to this after a break
- Try creating a few more files in your repo
- Ask AI: "Walk me through creating a GitHub repo"

**If you want to do more but don't know what:**
- Edit your README.md to describe yourself
- Create a file called `ideas.md` and list things you want to build
- Browse [awesome lists](https://github.com/topics/awesome) for inspiration
- Try an exercise: [Create a Repo Exercise](../../exercises/github-fundamentals/01-create-repo.md)

**If you broke something:**
- You probably didn't! But if you're worried...
- See [When Things Break](when-things-break.md)
- Worst case: Delete the repo and start over (it's yours!)
