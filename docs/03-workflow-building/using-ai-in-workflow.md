# Using AI in Your Workflow

How to integrate AI assistants into each stage of your development process. Learn when to use one AI vs. multiple AIs working together.

## The AI Collaboration Spectrum

```
No AI → Single AI → Multi-AI → AI Orchestra
(Manual)  (Assistant)  (Specialists)  (Automated pipeline)
```

Start simple, add complexity only when needed.

## Single-Agent Workflows

**What it is:** Using one AI tool throughout your entire project.

### When to Use Single-Agent

✅ **Perfect for:**
- Learning projects

- Quick prototypes
- Solo development
- Tight budgets (one subscription)

❌ **Not ideal for:**
- Critical production code
- Complex systems
- Team projects needing consensus
- When you need specialized expertise

### Single-Agent Approach

**Option 1: GitHub Copilot as Primary**
```
Planning: You think, Copilot suggests
Building: Copilot autocompletes as you type
Testing: You write test, Copilot completes
Review: Copilot suggests improvements inline
```

**Pros:**
- Seamless integration in editor
- Fast autocomplete
- Understands your codebase context

**Cons:**
- Limited for high-level discussions
- Not great for learning concepts
- Can't review whole files easily

**Option 2: ChatGPT as Primary**
```
Planning: Chat about requirements
Building: Generate code blocks, paste into editor
Testing: Generate test cases
Review: Paste code for review
```

**Pros:**
- Great for explanations
- Good at discussions
- Can handle full files
- Can explain reasoning

**Cons:**
- Manual copy-paste
- Loses context between sessions
- No editor integration

**Option 3: Claude as Primary**
```
Planning: Discuss architecture
Building: Generate code with reasoning
Testing: Create comprehensive tests
Review: Thorough code review with security focus
```

**Pros:**
- Excellent at reasoning
- Strong code review
- Good with complex problems
- Long context window

**Cons:**
- Manual copy-paste
- No live editing
- Slower than autocomplete

### Single-Agent Workflow Example

**Building a user registration feature with ChatGPT only:**

```
Step 1: Planning
You: "Help me plan a user registration API endpoint. 
What should I consider?"

ChatGPT: [provides comprehensive plan]

Step 2: Building
You: "Generate FastAPI code for user registration 
with email validation"

ChatGPT: [generates code]
You: [copy into editor]

Step 3: Testing
You: "Create pytest tests for this registration code:
[paste code]"

ChatGPT: [generates tests]
You: [copy into test file]

Step 4: Review
You: "Review this code for security issues:
[paste final code]"

ChatGPT: [provides review and suggestions]
You: [make improvements]

Done!
```

## Multi-Agent Workflows

**What it is:** Using multiple AI tools, each for what it does best.

### When to Use Multi-Agent

✅ **Perfect for:**
- Production code
- Complex projects
- Security-critical applications
- When you want multiple perspectives
- Learning (see different approaches)

❌ **Not ideal for:**
- Quick prototypes
- Learning basics (pick one tool first)
- Tight budgets
- Simple scripts

### Common Multi-Agent Patterns

**Pattern 1: Build + Review**
```
Agent 1 (Copilot): Generates code quickly
Agent 2 (Claude): Reviews for quality and security
```

**Pattern 2: Explain + Implement**
```
Agent 1 (ChatGPT): Explains concepts and approach
Agent 2 (Copilot): Implements while you type
```

**Pattern 3: Rapid + Thorough**
```
Agent 1 (Copilot): Quick first draft
Agent 2 (ChatGPT): Refine and add features
Agent 3 (Claude): Final security review
```

**Pattern 4: Specialist Roles**
```
Agent 1 (Copilot): Code generation
Agent 2 (ChatGPT): Testing strategies
Agent 3 (Claude): Security audit
Agent 4 (ChatGPT): Documentation
```

### Multi-Agent Workflow Example

**Building user registration with multiple AIs:**

```
Step 1: Planning (ChatGPT)
You: "Help me plan a secure user registration system"

ChatGPT: [provides detailed plan including security considerations]

Step 2: Architecture Discussion (Claude)
You: "Review this plan for a user registration system:
[paste ChatGPT's plan]
Focus on security and scalability."

Claude: [provides security-focused feedback, suggests improvements]

Step 3: Building (GitHub Copilot)
You: [Start typing in editor]
# Create user registration endpoint
def register_user...

Copilot: [autocompletes with code]

Step 4: Explain Complex Parts (ChatGPT)
You: "Explain this password hashing code:
[paste Copilot-generated hashing code]"

ChatGPT: [explains how bcrypt works and why it's secure]

Step 5: Generate Tests (ChatGPT)
You: "Create comprehensive pytest tests for user registration"

ChatGPT: [generates tests including edge cases]

Step 6: Security Review (Claude)
You: "Security audit this registration code:
[paste complete code]
Check for vulnerabilities."

Claude: [detailed security review, finds potential issues]

Step 7: Fix Issues (Copilot)
You: [Fix vulnerabilities Claude found]
Copilot: [helps implement secure versions]

Step 8: Final Review (ChatGPT)
You: "Does this implementation match our original requirements?
Requirements: [paste]
Code: [paste]"

ChatGPT: [verifies all requirements met]

Done!
```

## AI Tools by Stage

### Planning Stage

**Best: Claude or ChatGPT**

Why: Need conversation and reasoning, not code generation.

**Good prompts:**
```
"Help me break down [feature] into smaller tasks"

"What are the architectural considerations for [system]?"

"What could go wrong with [approach]?"

"Compare these two approaches: [A] vs [B]"
```

**Example:**
```
You: "I want to build a RESTful API for a todo app. 
Help me plan the endpoints and data structure."

Claude: "Let's think through this systematically:

Endpoints needed:
- GET /todos - List all todos
- POST /todos - Create new todo
- GET /todos/{id} - Get specific todo
- PUT /todos/{id} - Update todo
- DELETE /todos/{id} - Delete todo

Data structure:
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "title": "string",
  "completed": "boolean",
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "updated_at": "timestamp"
}

Considerations:
1. Pagination for list endpoint
2. Validation rules for title
3. Error handling for not found
4. Authentication (optional for v1)

Should we dive deeper into any area?"
```

### Building Stage

**Best: GitHub Copilot (with Copilot Chat for questions)**

Why: Real-time autocomplete while typing, understands codebase context.

**When you need more:** Use ChatGPT/Claude for:
- Complete file generation
- Complex algorithms
- Boilerplate code
- Explanations

**Example with Copilot:**
```python
# Copilot flow - just start typing comments
# Create FastAPI endpoint for user registration
# [Copilot completes the endpoint]

# Validate email format
# [Copilot generates validation function]

# Hash password with bcrypt
# [Copilot generates hashing code]
```

**Example with ChatGPT:**
```
You: "Generate a complete FastAPI app with:
- User registration endpoint
- Email validation
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- SQLAlchemy models"

ChatGPT: [generates complete application code]
```

### Testing Stage

**Best: ChatGPT or Claude**

Why: Good at generating comprehensive test cases and edge cases.

**Good prompts:**
```
"Create pytest tests for this function: [paste code]"

"What edge cases should I test for [feature]?"

"Generate test data for testing [scenario]"

"Create integration tests for these endpoints: [list]"
```

**Example:**
```
You: "Create comprehensive tests for this user registration function:
[paste code]

Include:
- Happy path tests
- Validation tests
- Edge cases
- Error handling tests"

ChatGPT: [generates complete test suite with all scenarios]
```

### Review Stage

**Best: Claude**

Why: Excellent at thorough analysis, security review, and providing reasoning.

**Good prompts:**
```
"Review this code for security vulnerabilities: [paste]"

"Check this code for bugs and code quality issues: [paste]"

"Does this code follow Python best practices? [paste]"

"What would you improve in this implementation? [paste]"
```

**Example:**
```
You: "Security audit this user authentication code:
[paste complete authentication system]"

Claude: "I'll review this systematically:

Security Issues Found:
1. Password stored in plain text (line 23)
   - FIX: Use bcrypt.hashpw()
   
2. SQL query uses string formatting (line 45)
   - RISK: SQL injection
   - FIX: Use parameterized queries
   
3. No rate limiting on login endpoint
   - RISK: Brute force attacks
   - FIX: Add rate limiting middleware

Code Quality:
1. Error messages too verbose (leak info)
2. No input length limits
3. Missing type hints

Would you like detailed fixes for any of these?"
```

### Documentation Stage

**Best: ChatGPT**

Why: Natural language generation, good at explaining concepts clearly.

**Good prompts:**
```
"Write API documentation for these endpoints: [paste]"

"Create a README for this project: [describe project]"

"Generate docstrings for these functions: [paste]"

"Explain this code for a beginner: [paste]"
```

## Choosing Your Approach

### Decision Tree

```
Is this a learning project?
├─ Yes → Single-agent (pick one, master it)

**Use for:** Learning, critical decisions, architectural choices

### Iterative Refinement

```
Agent 1: First draft
You: Review
Agent 2: Improve
You: Review
Agent 3: Final polish
```

**Pros:** Incremental improvement, learn from each iteration
**Cons:** Time-intensive

**Use for:** Complex problems, learning new patterns

### Specialist Calling

```
Default to Agent 1, call specialists when needed
```

**Pros:** Efficient, focused expertise
**Cons:** Need to know which specialist for what

**Use for:** Day-to-day development

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Copilot + ChatGPT (Most Popular)

```

Questions: ChatGPT explains
Complex problems: ChatGPT plans, Copilot implements
```

**Cost:** $30/month
**Complexity:** Low
**Effectiveness:** High

### Pattern: All-ChatGPT

```
Everything through ChatGPT conversations
Copy-paste code to/from editor
```

**Cost:** $20/month (or free tier)
**Complexity:** Very low
**Effectiveness:** Medium (slower than inline)

### Pattern: Claude for Thinking, Copilot for Coding

```
Planning/Design: Claude (better reasoning)

**Effectiveness:** Maximum

## Avoiding Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Too Many Agents

**Problem:**
```
Using 4 different AIs for a 10-line script
Spending more time managing AIs than coding
```

**Solution:** Start with one, add only when needed.

### Mistake 2: Not Specializing

**Problem:**
```
Using ChatGPT for everything when Copilot would be faster
Using Copilot for security review when Claude is better
```

**Solution:** Match tool to task.

### Mistake 3: Blind Trust

**Problem:**
```
Agent 1 says X
Agent 2 says Y
Agent 3 says Z
You don't know what to do
```

**Solution:** Understand the code yourself. AIs assist, you decide.

### Mistake 4: No Verification

**Problem:**
```
AI generates code → You ship it → It breaks in production
```

**Solution:** Always test, regardless of which AI wrote it.
