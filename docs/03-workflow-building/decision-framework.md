# Decision Framework

Quick decision trees to help you choose the right approach for any coding task.

## How to Use This Framework

When starting a new task, use these decision trees to quickly determine:
- Which workflow to use
- Which stages to include
- Which tools to use
- How thorough to be

**Time investment:** 2-5 minutes of thinking saves hours of work.

---

## Decision Tree 1: Which Workflow?

```
START: What are you building?

├─ Learning exercise or experiment?
│  └─ YES → Use MINIMAL WORKFLOW
│     • Three Questions
│     • Code
│     • Test it works
│     • Done
│
└─ NO → Is anyone else using it?
   │
   ├─ Just me
   │  └─ How long will you use it?
   │     ├─ One time → MINIMAL WORKFLOW
   │     ├─ Few weeks → LIGHT WORKFLOW (add git + docs)
   │     └─ Months+ → BALANCED WORKFLOW (add tests + review)
   │
   ├─ Small team/friends (< 50 users)
   │  └─ BALANCED WORKFLOW
   │     • Plan
   │     • Build with tests
   │     • Self-review or AI review
   │     • Deploy
   │
   └─ Many users (50+) or paying customers
      └─ COMPREHENSIVE WORKFLOW
         • Design
         • Plan thoroughly
         • Build with TDD
         • Multiple reviews
         • Security audit
         • Monitored deployment
```

---

## Decision Tree 2: Testing Strategy

```
START: How critical is this code?

├─ Learning or throwaway?
│  └─ Manual testing only
│     • Run it
│     • See if it works
│     • Done
│
├─ Personal project?
│  └─ What will break if there are bugs?
│     ├─ Nothing important → Manual testing
│     ├─ Will be annoying → Basic automated tests
│     └─ Will lose data → Comprehensive tests
│
├─ Shared project?
│  └─ Automated tests required
│     • Test happy paths
│     • Test one edge case per feature
│     • Test error handling
│
└─ Production system?
   └─ Comprehensive testing required
      • Unit tests (individual functions)
      • Integration tests (components together)
      • End-to-end tests (full flows)
      • Edge cases
      • Error scenarios
      • Performance tests
```

**Quick rule:** More users = more tests

---

## Decision Tree 3: Review Strategy

```
START: Who will maintain this code?

├─ Just me, one-time script
│  └─ No review needed
│     • Ship it
│
├─ Just me, ongoing project
│  └─ Self-review checklist
│     • Does it work?
│     • Is it readable?
│     • Will I understand it in 6 months?
│
├─ Small team
│  └─ Choose based on time:
│     ├─ Urgent → AI review only
│     ├─ Normal → AI + self-review
│     └─ Important → AI + peer review
│
└─ Production or client work
   └─ Multiple reviews required
      • Self-review checklist
      • AI code review (Claude)
      • Peer review
      • Security review (if handling data)
```

**Quick rule:** More users = more reviews

---

## Decision Tree 4: AI Tool Selection

```
START: What do you need help with?

├─ Real-time coding assistance?
│  └─ Use GitHub Copilot
│     • Autocomplete as you type
│     • Understands your codebase
│     • Fast and in-editor
│
├─ Explaining concepts or planning?
│  └─ Use ChatGPT or Claude
│     ├─ Quick questions → ChatGPT
│     ├─ Deep reasoning → Claude
│     └─ Both are good for learning
│
├─ Code review or security?
│  └─ Use Claude
│     • Thorough analysis
│     • Security-focused
│     • Explains reasoning well
│
├─ Generating tests?
│  └─ Use ChatGPT or Claude
│     • Either works great
│     • Give complete code context
│
└─ Complex multi-file refactoring?
   └─ Use Cursor or Windsurf
      • Built for codebase-wide changes
      • Better context management
```

**Can afford multiple tools?**

Ideal combination:
- Copilot: Daily coding
- ChatGPT: Questions and tests
- Claude: Reviews and security

## Common Decision Patterns

### The "Prototype to Production" Pattern

```
Phase 1 (Week 1): Minimal workflow
• Just make it work
• No tests, no review
• Validate the idea

Phase 2 (Week 2): If idea is good
• Add tests
• Add basic review
• Clean up code

Phase 3 (Month 1): If getting users
• Add monitoring
• Add documentation
• Add security review

Phase 4 (Month 2+): If successful
• Add comprehensive testing
• Add multiple reviews
• Professional deployment
```

### The "Client Work" Pattern

```
Always use comprehensive workflow:
• Design → Plan → Build → Test → Review → Deploy → Monitor

No exceptions because:
• Reputation at stake
• Payment depends on quality
• Legal implications
• Client expects professionalism
```

### The "Startup MVP" Pattern

```
Balance speed and essential quality:

Must have:
• Basic planning
• Core functionality
• Security for sensitive data
• Monitoring

Can skip initially:
• Perfect code
• Comprehensive tests
• Full documentation
• Nice-to-have features

Add later after validation
```

## Meta-Decision: When to Use This Framework

### Use this framework when:

✅ Starting a new project
✅ Unsure which approach to take
✅ Want to validate your instincts
✅ Team needs alignment
✅ Stakes feel unclear

### Don't need this framework when:

❌ Doing something you've done 100 times
❌ Time is so urgent that deciding is slower than doing
❌ The decision is obvious
❌ You have a strong instinct and low stakes

**Trust your instincts as you gain experience!**

---

## Framework for Building Your Own Framework

Eventually, you'll develop your own decision-making process:

```markdown
## My Personal Decision Framework

### For API work, I:
[Your approach]

### For frontend work, I:
[Your approach]

### For data work, I:
[Your approach]

### When in doubt, I:
[Your fallback approach]
```

**This evolves with experience!**

---

## Emergency Override

Sometimes you need to break your own rules:

### Override rules when:

**Production is down**
→ Fix first, process later

**Opportunity is time-sensitive**
→ Ship fast, improve later

**Learning is the goal**
→ Experiment freely, ignore process

**Stakes changed mid-project**
→ Adjust workflow immediately

**New information appears**
→ Re-evaluate decisions

**The framework says one thing but your gut says another**
→ Trust experience over rules

---

## Practice Scenarios

Test your decision-making:

### Scenario 1
**Task:** Build a URL shortener for your team (10 people)
**Timeline:** 2 weeks
**Your decision:** _________________
**Recommended:** Balanced workflow with tests and review

### Scenario 2
**Task:** Fix typo in documentation
**Timeline:** Now
**Your decision:** _________________
