# Workflow Building

Welcome to the art of creating YOUR development process. There's no single "right way" - let's find what works for you.

## What Is a Workflow?

**The Simple Version:**
A workflow is your personal process for going from idea to working code.

Think of it like:
- A recipe (but flexible!)
- Your morning routine (but for coding)
- A checklist (but adaptable)

## Why Workflows Matter

### Without a Workflow

```
Idea → Start coding → Get stuck → Ask AI → Copy paste → 
→ It breaks → Fix randomly → Repeat → Maybe it works?
```

**Problems:**
- Inconsistent results
- Hard to debug
- Can't explain what you did
- Difficult to improve

### With a Workflow

```
Idea → Plan → Build → Test → Review → Deploy
  ↑                                      ↓
  └──────────── Learn ←─────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent quality
- Easy to debug (know where you are)
- Teachable process
- Continuous improvement

## The Core Principle

**Start simple. Add complexity only when needed.**

```
Week 1: Three questions
 ↓
Month 1: Add testing
 ↓
Month 3: Add review stage
 ↓
Month 6: Multi-agent checks
 ↓
Year 1: Your unique sophisticated workflow
```

## The Simplest Possible Workflow

Before we dive into details, here's the absolute minimum:

### The Three Questions

**Before writing any code, ask:**

1. **What am I building?** (1 sentence)
2. **How will I know it works?** (1 test case)
3. **What could go wrong?** (1 edge case)

That's it! Everything else builds from this foundation.

**Example:**
```
1. What: A function to calculate shipping cost
2. Test: calculate_shipping(weight=5, distance=100) should return $15
3. Edge case: What if weight is negative?
```

## Workflow Styles

### Style 1: Minimalist

**When:** Learning, small projects, solo work

**Process:**
```
1. Plan (5 min thinking)
2. Build (with AI help)
3. Test (run it manually)
4. Done
```

**Good for:**
- Tutorials
- Learning exercises
- Quick experiments

### Style 2: Balanced

**When:** Real projects, moderate stakes

**Process:**
```
1. Plan (write down requirements)
2. Build (AI-assisted)
3. Test (automated tests)
4. Review (AI code review)
5. Deploy
```

**Good for:**
- Side projects
- Small team work
- Portfolio pieces

### Style 3: Rigorous

**When:** Production code, high stakes

**Process:**
```
1. Design (architecture planning)
2. Plan (detailed requirements)
3. Build (TDD with AI)
4. Test (comprehensive)
5. Review (multiple AIs + human)
6. Security scan
7. Deploy
8. Monitor
```

**Good for:**
- Production systems
- Client work
- Critical applications

## Choosing Your Starting Point

### "I've never coded before"

**Start with:** Three Questions Workflow

**Why:** Builds thinking skills without overwhelming you

**Next step:** Add manual testing after 2 weeks

### "I've built a few things"

**Start with:** Balanced workflow

**Why:** You understand basics, ready for structure

**Next step:** Add automated tests when comfortable

### "I'm building production software"

**Start with:** Rigorous workflow

**Why:** Quality and reliability matter

**Next step:** Customize based on your domain

## The Workflow Evolution Path

### Stage 1: Chaotic (We all start here!)

```
No workflow. Code randomly. Hope it works.
```

**How to improve:** Add the Three Questions

### Stage 2: Structured

```
1. Plan
2. Build
3. Test manually
```

**How to improve:** Add automated tests

### Stage 3: Systematic

```
1. Plan with details
2. Build with AI
3. Test automatically
4. Review code
```

**How to improve:** Add multiple reviewers/AIs

### Stage 4: Sophisticated

```
1. Design architecture
2. Plan in detail
3. Build with AI assistance
4. Test comprehensively
5. Multi-AI review
6. Security scan
7. Performance check
```

**How to improve:** Measure and optimize each stage

## Common Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: AI-First

```
AI generates → You review → You test → Deploy
```

**Pros:** Fast
**Cons:** Depends heavily on AI quality

### Pattern 2: Test-First

```
Write test → AI generates code → Run test → Refine
```

**Pros:** Quality built-in
**Cons:** Slower initially

### Pattern 3: Design-First

```
Design → Plan → AI assists building → Review → Test
```

**Pros:** Clear direction
**Cons:** More upfront work

### Pattern 4: Iterative

```
Build small piece → Test → Review → Next piece
```

**Pros:** Continuous feedback
**Cons:** Can lose big picture

## Workflow Components

### Planning Stage

**Questions to answer:**
- What are we building?
- Why do we need it?
- What are the requirements?
- What are the constraints?

**Tools:**
- Claude/ChatGPT for brainstorming
- Markdown doc for requirements
- Diagrams if complex

**Output:** Clear requirements document

### Building Stage

**Activities:**
- Write code
- Use AI for assistance
- Commit frequently
- Document as you go

**Tools:**
- GitHub Copilot for coding
- Git for version control
- Comments for documentation

**Output:** Working code (or increment)

### Testing Stage

**Types of testing:**
- Unit tests (individual functions)
- Integration tests (components together)
- Manual testing (try it yourself)
- Edge case testing

**Tools:**
- pytest/unittest (Python)
- jest (JavaScript)
- Your hands and eyes

**Output:** Confidence code works

### Review Stage

**What to review:**
- Does it meet requirements?
- Is it readable?
- Are there bugs?
- Is it secure?
- Is it maintainable?

**Tools:**
- Claude for thorough review
- AI code review
- Human reviewers
- Linters

**Output:** Improved code quality

## Integrating AI into Your Workflow

### Where AI Helps Most

**Planning:**
- Brainstorm approaches
- Suggest architectures
- Identify risks

**Building:**
- Generate boilerplate
- Complete patterns
- Suggest implementations

**Testing:**
- Generate test cases
- Identify edge cases
- Create test data

**Review:**
- Spot bugs
- Suggest improvements
- Check security

### Where AI Helps Least

- Making judgment calls
- Understanding your users
- Knowing your business rules
- Long-term vision

## Measuring Your Workflow

### Key Questions

**Effectiveness:**
- Does code work correctly?
- Are bugs caught early?
- Is quality consistent?

**Efficiency:**
- How long does it take?
- Where do you get stuck?
- What's repetitive?

**Satisfaction:**
- Do you enjoy the process?
- Do you feel confident?
- Are you learning?

### Simple Metrics

Track for a week:
```markdown
## Project: [name]
- Time to plan: X minutes
- Time to build: Y minutes
- Time to test: Z minutes
- Bugs found: N
- Feeling: [good/okay/frustrated]
```

After a week, see patterns:
- What takes longest?
- Where do most bugs appear?
- When do you feel best?

Adjust workflow accordingly!

## Common Questions

### "Do I really need a workflow?"

For tiny experiments? No.
For anything you'll maintain? Yes.

Start simple and add structure as projects grow.

### "Isn't following a process slow?"

At first, yes. But:
- You spend less time stuck
- Fewer bugs to fix later
- Can work faster as you practice
- Less rework overall

### "Can I skip stages?"

Absolutely! Your workflow, your rules.

Start with what makes sense, add what you need.

### "What if my workflow doesn't work?"

Perfect! That means you're learning.
- Try a different approach
- Simplify if it's too complex
- Add structure if it's too chaotic
- Keep iterating

## Feeling Stuck?

**If workflows seem too formal:**
- Start with just the Three Questions
- Add one stage at a time
- Skip documentation if you want
- Make it work for YOU

**If you're overwhelmed by options:**
- Pick the simplest workflow
- Use it for a week
- Adjust based on pain points
- Evolve gradually

**If nothing seems to fit:**
- That's okay! Create your own
- Use these as inspiration
- Mix and match
- Trust your instincts

- [ ] You have a workflow you follow consistently
- [ ] You've built a few projects with it
- [ ] You want to learn common solutions
- [ ] You're curious about best practices
