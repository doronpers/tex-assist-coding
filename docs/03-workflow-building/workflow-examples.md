## Example 1: Personal Learning Project

### Scenario

**Project:** Build a command-line weather app
**Developer:** Complete beginner learning Python
**Timeline:** Weekend project (1-2 days)
**Users:** Just yourself
**Stakes:** Very low - learning exercise

### Risk Assessment

```
Users: Just me
If it breaks: No problem, rebuild it
Sensitive data: No
Duration: Will use for a few weeks
Complexity: Simple (< 200 lines)
Change frequency: Rarely
```

**Conclusion:** Minimal workflow appropriate

### The Workflow

#### Stage 1: Planning (15 minutes)

**Three Questions:**
```
1. WHAT: CLI app that shows current weather for a city
2. TEST: Type "python weather.py London" → shows temperature and conditions
3. EDGE: What if city name is invalid or API is down?
```

**Tools:** Just your brain and a text file

#### Stage 2: Building (3 hours)

**With GitHub Copilot:**

```python
# 1. Start with comment
# Create a weather app that fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap API

# Copilot suggests imports
import requests
import sys

# Define API key and endpoint
# Copilot completes with sensible defaults

# Create function to get weather
def get_weather(city):
    # Copilot suggests API call
    pass

# Create main function
def main():
    # Copilot suggests argument parsing
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Questions to ChatGPT:**
```
Q: "How do I get an API key from OpenWeatherMap?"
A: [ChatGPT explains process]

Q: "How do I parse command line arguments in Python?"
A: [ChatGPT shows sys.argv and argparse options]

Q: "What's a good free weather API for learning?"
A: [ChatGPT suggests OpenWeatherMap with free tier]
```

**Time breakdown:**
- Set up API key: 20 min
- Write main logic: 1 hour
- Add error handling: 30 min
- Make output pretty: 40 min
- Fix bugs: 30 min

#### Stage 3: Testing (20 minutes)

**Manual testing:**
```bash
# Test normal case
python weather.py London
# ✓ Works

# Test invalid city
python weather.py AsdfGhjkl
# ✓ Shows error message

# Test without arguments
python weather.py
# ✓ Shows usage instructions
```

**Done!** No automated tests needed for personal project.

#### Total Time: ~4 hours

**Stages used:** 2 (Planning, Building with testing)
**Stages skipped:** Review, Documentation, Deployment, Monitoring

### What Worked

✅ Quick planning kept me focused
✅ Copilot sped up boilerplate
✅ ChatGPT answered questions quickly
✅ Manual testing was sufficient
✅ Learned a lot in one weekend

### What Could Improve

💡 Should have git committed more often
💡 Could have added tests for practice
💡 Documentation would help if I return in 6 months
