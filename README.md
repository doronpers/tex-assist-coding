Learn to code with AI as your pair programmer. No timeline, no pressure - explore at your own pace.

## 🎯 What This Is

- A **guidebook** for learning AI-assisted development
- **Generic examples** and patterns (not production code)
- Tools for building **YOUR workflow** (not following someone else's)
- Safe **playground** for experimentation

## 🚫 What This Isn't

- A traditional coding bootcamp with deadlines
- A rigid curriculum you must follow in order
- Production-ready code (it's for learning)
- One "right way" to do things

## 👥 Who This Is For

- **Complete coding novices** - Never written code before
- **Technical leaders** - Managing dev teams, want to understand code
- **Curious learners** - Want to explore AI-assisted development
- **Project builders** - Building software with AI help

## 🚀 Quick Start (Pick Your Path)

### Path 1: "I've never used GitHub"
→ Start with [`docs/01-github-basics/README.md`](docs/01-github-basics/README.md)

### Path 2: "I want to understand AI coding tools"
→ Start with [`docs/02-ai-tools/README.md`](docs/02-ai-tools/README.md)

### Path 3: "I want to build something NOW"
→ Start with [`examples/01-hello-api/`](examples/01-hello-api/) and follow HOW_TO_BUILD.md

### Path 4: "I want to design my workflow"
→ Start with [`docs/03-workflow-building/README.md`](docs/03-workflow-building/README.md)

### Path 5: "I'm a technical leader learning to oversee developers"
→ Start with [`scenarios/technical-leader-learning.md`](scenarios/technical-leader-learning.md)

## 📚 What's Inside

- **[GitHub Basics](docs/01-github-basics/)** - Version control, repos, branches, PRs (with analogies)
- **[AI Tools](docs/02-ai-tools/)** - Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT - how to use them effectively
- **[Workflow Building](docs/03-workflow-building/)** - Create YOUR process from simple to sophisticated
- **[Patterns](docs/04-patterns/)** - APIs, validation, testing, security, frontend
- **[Examples](examples/)** - 5 complete working projects with step-by-step AI-assisted builds
- **[Templates](templates/)** - Learning journal, PR descriptions, workflow designs
- **[Exercises](exercises/)** - Hands-on practice for GitHub, AI coding, workflow design
- **[Scenarios](scenarios/)** - Real-world paths for different learning situations

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

### No Timeline
- Stay on any topic as long as you need
- Skip what doesn't interest you
- Return when you're ready

### Exploration Over Prescription
- Multiple paths, not one correct sequence
- "Try this when curious" not "Do this now"
- Your workflow, your pace, your choices

### Build Confidence Through Success
- Start extremely simple
- Quick wins early
- Gradual complexity
- Celebrate progress
