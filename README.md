Learn to code with AI as your pair programmer. No timeline, no pressure - explore at your own pace.

> ⚠️ **Active Development**: This guide is in **active development**. Content is being added, refined, and expanded continuously. New examples, exercises, and learning paths are regularly added.

## 🎯 What This Is

- A **guidebook** for learning AI-assisted development
- **Generic examples** and patterns (not production code)
- Tools for building **YOUR workflow** (not following someone else's)
- Safe **playground** for experimentation

## 🚫 What This Isn't

- A traditional coding bootcamp with deadlines
- A rigid curriculum you must follow in order
- Production-ready code (it's for learning)
- One "right way" to do things

## 👥 Who This Is For

- **Complete coding novices** - Never written code before
- **Technical leaders** - Managing dev teams, want to understand code
- **Curious learners** - Want to explore AI-assisted development
- **Project builders** - Building software with AI help

## 🚀 Quick Start (Pick Your Path)

### Path 1: "I've never coded before" ✨ NEW
→ Start with [`scenarios/complete-beginner-path.md`](scenarios/complete-beginner-path.md) - Your complete roadmap

### Path 2: "I've never used GitHub"
→ Start with [`documentation/01-github-basics/README.md`](documentation/01-github-basics/README.md)

### Path 3: "I want to understand AI coding tools"
→ Start with [`documentation/02-ai-tools/README.md`](documentation/02-ai-tools/README.md)

### Path 4: "I want to build something NOW"
→ Start with [`examples/01-hello-api/`](examples/01-hello-api/) and follow HOW_TO_BUILD.md

### Path 5: "I want to design my workflow"
→ Start with [`documentation/03-workflow-building/README.md`](documentation/03-workflow-building/README.md)

### Path 6: "I'm a technical leader learning to oversee developers"
→ Start with [`scenarios/technical-leader-learning.md`](scenarios/technical-leader-learning.md)

## 📚 What's Inside

- **[GitHub Basics](documentation/01-github-basics/)** Available - Version control, repos, branches, PRs (with analogies)
- **[AI Tools](documentation/02-ai-tools/)** Available - Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT - how to use them effectively
- **[Workflow Building](documentation/03-workflow-building/)** Available - Create YOUR process from simple to sophisticated
- **[Patterns](documentation/04-patterns/)** In Development - API basics, validation, testing, security principles (more coming!)
- **[Examples](examples/)** In Development - Complete working projects with step-by-step AI-assisted builds (more coming!)
- **[Templates](templates/)** Available - Learning journal, PR descriptions, project READMEs
- **[Exercises](exercises/)** In Development - Hands-on practice for GitHub and coding (more exercises being added)
- **[Scenarios](scenarios/)** Available - Complete beginner path and technical leader learning path

## 🔄 Reusable Resources

**New!** All learning resources are now organized in the [`reusable/`](reusable/) directory for easy access and repurposing across multiple repositories.

- **[Reusable Directory](reusable/README.md)** - Organized, portable learning resources
- **[Portability Guide](reusable/PORTABILITY.md)** - How to use these resources in other repos
- Quick access to philosophy, paths, exercises, templates, and guides

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

**Your learning path should fit you, not the other way around.**

- Learn what energizes you, not what you "should" learn
- Multiple valid paths - no single "correct" sequence
- Workflows should fit you, not vice versa
- Focus on fulfilling work right now, not arbitrary goals

*Based on individualized learning principles - see [documentation/dark-horse-approach.md](documentation/dark-horse-approach.md) for details.*
