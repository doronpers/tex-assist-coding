Learn to code with AI as your pair programmer. No timeline, no pressure - explore at your own pace.

## 🎯 What This Is

- A **guidebook** for learning AI-assisted development
- **Generic examples** and patterns (not production code)
- Tools for building **YOUR workflow** (not following someone else's)
- Safe **playground** for experimentation

## 🚫 What This Isn't

- A traditional coding bootcamp with deadlines
- A rigid curriculum you must follow in order
- Production-ready code (it's for learning)
- One "right way" to do things

## 👥 Who This Is For

- **Complete coding novices** - Never written code before
- **Technical leaders** - Managing dev teams, want to understand code
- **Curious learners** - Want to explore AI-assisted development
- **Project builders** - Building software with AI help

## 🚀 Quick Start (Pick Your Path)

### Path 1: "I've never coded before" ✨ NEW
→ Start with [`scenarios/complete-beginner-path.md`](scenarios/complete-beginner-path.md) - Your complete roadmap

### Path 2: "I've never used GitHub"
→ Start with [`docs/01-github-basics/README.md`](docs/01-github-basics/README.md)

### Path 3: "I want to understand AI coding tools"
→ Start with [`docs/02-ai-tools/README.md`](docs/02-ai-tools/README.md)

### Path 4: "I want to build something NOW"
→ Start with [`examples/01-hello-api/`](examples/01-hello-api/) and follow HOW_TO_BUILD.md

### Path 5: "I want to design my workflow"
→ Start with [`docs/03-workflow-building/README.md`](docs/03-workflow-building/README.md)

### Path 6: "I'm a technical leader learning to oversee developers"
→ Start with [`scenarios/technical-leader-learning.md`](scenarios/technical-leader-learning.md)

## 📚 What's Inside

- **[GitHub Basics](docs/01-github-basics/)** ✅ Complete - Version control, repos, branches, PRs (with analogies)
- **[AI Tools](docs/02-ai-tools/)** ✅ Complete - Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT - how to use them effectively
- **[Workflow Building](docs/03-workflow-building/)** ✅ Complete - Create YOUR process from simple to sophisticated
- **[Patterns](docs/04-patterns/)** 🚧 Growing - API basics, validation, testing, security principles (more coming!)
- **[Examples](examples/)** 🚧 Growing - Complete working projects with step-by-step AI-assisted builds (1 complete, more coming)
- **[Templates](templates/)** ✅ 3 templates - Learning journal, PR descriptions, project READMEs
- **[Exercises](exercises/)** 🚧 Growing - Hands-on practice for GitHub and coding (more exercises being added)
- **[Scenarios](scenarios/)** ✅ 2 scenarios - Complete beginner path and technical leader learning path

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

Built on **[Dark Horse principles](docs/dark-horse-approach.md)** - honoring your individuality over standardized paths.

### Follow YOUR Micro-motives
- What specifically energizes you about coding?
- Build projects that align with YOUR interests
- Your unique combination is your strength
- [Discover your micro-motives →](docs/dark-horse-approach.md#1-know-your-micro-motives)

### Know YOUR Choices
- Multiple valid paths, not one "correct" sequence
- Learn in the order that serves YOU
- Skip, jump, circle back freely
- Your learning, your decisions

### Develop YOUR Strategies
- Workflows should fit you, not vice versa
- Your optimal approach ≠ "best practices"
- Experiment, keep what works, discard what doesn't
- [Design your workflow →](docs/03-workflow-building/workflow-builder.md)

### Ignore the Destination
- Focus on fulfilling work right now, not arbitrary goals
- Compare only to your past self
- Redefine success by YOUR metrics
- Excellence emerges from authentic alignment
