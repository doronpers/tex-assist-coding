# Exercise 1: Create Your First Repository

**Goal:** Get comfortable with GitHub basics by creating and using a repository.

**Time:** 15-20 minutes

**Difficulty:** Beginner (No prerequisites!)

## What You'll Learn

- Creating a GitHub repository
- Adding files
- Making commits
- Understanding commit history
- Exploring GitHub's interface

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account (free - create at github.com)
- A web browser
- Curiosity!

## Instructions

### Part 1: Create a Repository (5 minutes)

1. **Go to GitHub.com and log in**

2. **Click the "+" icon** (top right) → "New repository"

3. **Fill in the details:**
   - **Repository name:** `my-first-repo` (or anything you like!)
   - **Description:** "Learning GitHub basics"
   - **Public or Private:** Choose "Public" (you can always change this)
   - **✅ Check "Add a README file"**
   - Leave other options as default

4. **Click "Create repository"**

🎉 **You just created your first repository!**

### Part 2: Explore Your Repository (3 minutes)

Look around your new repo:

1. **Notice the tabs at the top:**
   - `<> Code` - Your files
   - `Issues` - Track problems or ideas
   - `Pull requests` - Proposed changes
   - More...

2. **See the README.md file**
   - It shows up automatically below the file list
   - It's formatted nicely (that's Markdown!)

3. **Notice the commit message:**
   - "Initial commit" created by GitHub
   - Click on it to see what changed

**Questions to think about:**
- What do you see in the repository?
- Where is your README.md file?
- What's the default branch name?

### Part 3: Add a New File (5 minutes)

Let's add a file through GitHub's web interface:

1. **Click "Add file"** → "Create new file"

2. **Name the file:** `hello.txt`

3. **Add content:**
   ```
   Hello, GitHub!
   
   This is my first file in my first repository.
   
   Today's date: [write today's date]
   What I'm learning: GitHub basics
   ```

4. **Scroll down to "Commit new file"**
   - See the commit message box? That describes what you did
   - Default message: "Create hello.txt"
   - **Add your own message:** "Add my first text file"

5. **Click "Commit new file"**

✅ **You just made your first commit!**

### Part 4: Edit a File (5 minutes)

Now let's modify the file:

1. **Click on `hello.txt`** to open it

2. **Click the pencil icon** (✏️) to edit

3. **Add more content:**
   ```
   Update: I just learned how to edit files on GitHub!
   
   Things I can do now:
   - Create repositories
   - Add files
   - Edit files
   - Make commits
   ```

4. **Scroll down to commit:**
   - Message: "Update hello.txt with my learning progress"
   - Click "Commit changes"

✅ **You just made your second commit!**

### Part 5: View Your History (3 minutes)

Let's see what you've done:

1. **Click "commits"** (above the file list - shows a number like "3 commits")

2. **See your history:**
   - Most recent at the top
   - Each commit has a message
   - Each commit has a unique ID

3. **Click on a commit** to see what changed:
   - Green lines = added
   - Red lines = deleted

4. **Click the commit ID** (the random letters/numbers)
   - This is a link you can share
   - Anyone can see exactly this version

**Amazing!** You can see every change you've ever made!

## Reflection Questions

Take a moment to think:

1. **What surprised you about GitHub?**
   
   
2. **What was easier than you expected?**
   
   
3. **What was harder than you expected?**
   
   
4. **What would you like to learn next?**
   

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

### Challenge 1: Add Multiple Files

Create these files in your repo:
- `ideas.txt` - List things you want to build
- `notes.md` - Note about what you learned today
- `todo.txt` - Your GitHub learning goals

### Challenge 2: Explore the README

1. Click on `README.md`
2. Click edit (pencil icon)
3. Add more content using Markdown:
   ```markdown
   # My Learning Repository
   
   ## What I'm Learning
   - GitHub basics
   - Making commits
   - Version control
   
   ## Projects I Want to Build
   1. First project idea
   2. Second project idea
   ```
4. Click "Preview" to see it formatted
5. Commit changes

### Challenge 3: Explore Your Profile

1. Click your profile picture (top right)
2. Click "Your profile"
3. See your new repository listed!
4. This is your public GitHub presence

### Challenge 4: Delete and Restore

**Try breaking things safely:**

1. Delete `hello.txt` (Click on it → trash icon → confirm)
2. Oh no! But wait...
3. Go to commits, find when you created it
4. See the file content in that commit
5. **Learning:** Nothing is ever truly lost!

To actually restore it:
1. View the commit that has the file
2. Click "Browse files" at that commit
3. Copy the content
4. Create a new file with that content

## Common Mistakes (Don't Worry!)

### Mistake 1: Forgot to Add Commit Message

**What happens:** GitHub won't let you commit without a message

**Why:** Commit messages are how you remember what you did

**Fix:** Just add a message - even "Update file" is fine!

### Mistake 2: Created Private Repo By Accident

**What happened:** Can't find your repo to show friends

**Fix:** Settings → Change visibility → Make public

### Mistake 3: Committed the Wrong File

**What happened:** Added something by mistake

**Why it's OK:** You can delete it in another commit

**Fix:** Delete the file and commit: "Remove accidental file"

## Getting Help

### If something didn't work:

2. **Try again** - Sometimes a refresh helps
3. **Ask AI:** "I'm trying to [action] on GitHub but [problem]"
