# Agent Behavioral Standards

**Purpose**: To ensure all AI agents working on this repository maintain the highest standards of code quality, thoroughness, and architectural integrity.

## 1. Core Mandates

### A. No Corner-Cutting

* **Complete Solutions**: Never provide "partial" or "place-holder" code unless explicitly requested for a quick prototype.
* **Error Handling**: All new code must include robust error handling, logging, and edge-case validation.
* **Documentation**: Every function, class, and module must be documented with clear docstrings and comments explaining the "why," not just the "how."

### B. Robust & Capable Solutions

* **Modern Practices**: Utilize the most modern and capable libraries and language features (e.g., Type Hinting, AsyncIO, Pydantic v2).
* **Scalability**: Design solutions that consider future growth, performance, and maintainability.
* **Standardization**: Adhere strictly to the project's established standards (e.g., 88-character line length, unified test patterns).

### C. Thorough Planning & Verification

* **Implementation Plans**: Before making significant changes, agents must provide a detailed implementation plan for user review.
* **Verification First**: Every change must be verified through automated tests. If tests don't exist, the agent must create them.
* **Zero Regressions**: Agents are responsible for ensuring that new features do not break existing functionality.

## 2. Agent Workflow

1. **Research**: Fully understand the existing context and constraints.
2. **Plan**: Draft a comprehensive plan that identifies risks and edge cases.
3. **Implement**: Write clean, efficient, and well-tested code.
4. **Verify**: Run the full test suite and linting passes.
5. **Refine**: Address any feedback or failures immediately and thoroughly.

**Note to Agents**: Abiding by these standards is not optional. It is the primary directive for maintaining the health and longevity of this codebase.
