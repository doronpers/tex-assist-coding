## 🔄 THE THREE-QUESTION FRAMEWORK (MANDATORY)

**Before writing ANY code or making ANY changes, you MUST answer these three questions:**

### 1. What problem am I solving?
- **Format**: 1-2 sentences, specific and clear
- **Test**: Can you explain it in 30 seconds?
- **Example**: ✅ "Users need to upload audio files up to 800MB for deepfake detection"  
  ❌ "Make the system better and faster" (too vague)

### 2. What does success look like?
- **Format**: Concrete, testable outcomes (not aspirations)
- **Test**: Can you write a test that validates success?
- **Example**: ✅ "POST /v1/voice/deepfake accepts WAV files up to 800MB and returns results in <30s"  
  ❌ "The system should work better" (too vague)

### 3. What constraints exist?
- **Format**: Non-negotiable limits in these categories:
  - **Performance**: Response time, throughput, memory
  - **Scale**: File size, batch size, rate limits
  - **Security**: Authentication, data handling, compliance
  - **Infrastructure**: Platform, technology, dependencies

**Template to use:**
```markdown
## Problem Definition

**Problem:** [1-2 sentence description]

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] [Specific, testable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Specific, testable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Specific, testable outcome 3]

**Constraints:**
- **Performance:** [specific limits]
- **Scale:** [specific limits]
- **Security:** [specific requirements]
- **Infrastructure:** [specific requirements]
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: If you cannot answer all three questions clearly, STOP and ask the user for clarification. Do not proceed with vague or undefined requirements.

## 📝 DOCUMENTATION PRINCIPLES (Dieter Rams Applied)

### The 10 Principles

1. **Innovative** - Explore new possibilities, enhance usability
2. **Useful** - Enable users to accomplish goals (task-oriented)
3. **Aesthetic** - Clean, uncluttered presentation
4. **Understandable** - Immediately comprehensible
5. **Unobtrusive** - Serve without overwhelming (progressive disclosure)
6. **Honest** - Accurate, tested, with known limitations
7. **Long-lasting** - Principle-based, not trend-chasing
8. **Thorough** - Complete down to the last detail
9. **Environmentally Friendly** - No duplication, single source of truth
10. **Minimal** - Less but better, concentrate on essential

### Documentation Standards Checklist

When creating/updating documentation:

- [ ] **Clear purpose statement** - What is this for? Who is it for?
- [ ] **Follows document template** - Quick Start → Main Content → Related Resources
- [ ] **Added to `documentation/INDEX.md`** - Navigation hub updated
- [ ] **Cross-references updated** - All links verified and working
- [ ] **No duplication** - Single source of truth for each concept
- [ ] **Progressive disclosure** - Basic → Advanced → Deep
- [ ] **Task-oriented** - Organized by user goals, not arbitrary categories
- [ ] **Honest limitations** - Known issues and constraints documented

### Document Template

```markdown
# Title - Clear Purpose Statement

[Brief description of what this document covers and who it's for]

## Quick Start / Overview
[Get users oriented immediately]

## Main Content
[Organized by user goals]

## Related Resources
[Help users go deeper]
```

---

## 💻 CODE QUALITY STANDARDS

### Behavioral Mandates (Non-Negotiable)

1. **No Corner-Cutting**
   - ✅ Complete solutions, never placeholders
   - ✅ Robust error handling, logging, edge-case validation
   - ✅ Clear docstrings explaining "why," not just "how"

2. **Robust & Capable**
   - ✅ Modern libraries and language features (Type Hints, AsyncIO, Pydantic v2)
   - ✅ Scalability considerations
   - ✅ Adhere to project standards (88-character line length, unified test patterns)

3. **Thorough Planning & Verification**
   - ✅ Detailed implementation plan for significant changes
   - ✅ Automated tests for all changes
   - ✅ Zero regressions - new features don't break existing functionality

### Code Example Requirements

Every code example MUST include:

- ✅ **Error handling** - Comprehensive try/except blocks
- ✅ **Environment variables** - No hardcoded secrets
- ✅ **Clear comments** - Explain non-obvious code
- ✅ **Language conventions** - Follow established patterns
- ✅ **Version compatibility** - Works with documented versions
- ✅ **README.md** - In example directory with:
  - Prerequisites
  - Quick Start (1-2-3 steps)
  - Example descriptions
  - Testing instructions

### Common AI Pitfalls (Always Check)

These are frequent mistakes—verify you haven't made them:

- ✅ **numpy type conversion** - Use `.item()` or `.tolist()` for JSON serialization
- ✅ **File descriptor handling** - Use `os.fdopen()` for temp files
- ✅ **Docker SSL certificates** - Include `ca-certificates` package
- ✅ **nginx file size limits** - Set `client_max_body_size` for large files (800MB+)
- ✅ **Python path handling** - Use `pathlib.Path` not string concatenation
- ✅ **Type hints** - Always include for function parameters and returns
- ✅ **Async context managers** - Properly handle async resources

### Testing Requirements

**Before ANY commit:**

```bash
# Python
cd examples/python && pytest tests/ -v

# TypeScript
cd examples/typescript && npm run build && npm test

# Node.js
cd examples/node && node --check *.js && npm test
```

**Test coverage expectations:**
- All new functions must have tests
- Edge cases must be covered
- Integration tests for API interactions
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

---

## 🔒 SECURITY & DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT

### Package Security (CRITICAL)

**When adding/updating Python packages:**

1. **ALWAYS use safety-mcp** to check package security
2. **ALWAYS use `latest_secure_version`** returned by safety-mcp
3. **NEVER use vulnerable versions** - even if they're the latest
4. **For existing packages**: Check if secure versions exist in same major version
5. **Inform user** of latest secure version if current is vulnerable

**Example workflow:**
```
User: "Add requests library"
→ Check safety-mcp for requests
→ Use latest_secure_version
→ Add to requirements.txt with secure version
→ Document version choice
```

### Security Best Practices

- ✅ **No secrets in code** - Use environment variables
- ✅ **API keys** - Never hardcode, always from env vars
- ✅ **SSL/TLS** - Always use HTTPS for API calls
- ✅ **Input validation** - Validate all user inputs
- ✅ **Error messages** - Don't leak sensitive information
- ✅ **Dependencies** - Keep updated, check for vulnerabilities

---

## 📋 NAMING CONVENTIONS

| Type | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Documentation | `UPPERCASE.md` | `FAQ.md`, `BEST_PRACTICES.md` |
| Python files | `snake_case.py` | `audio_validator.py` |
| JavaScript files | `kebab-case.js` | `batch-processor.js` |
| Shell scripts | `kebab-case.sh` | `deepfake-detect.sh` |
| Directories | `lowercase` or `kebab-case` | `examples/`, `workflow-guides/` |
| Classes | `PascalCase` | `AudioProcessor` |
| Functions | `snake_case` (Python) or `camelCase` (JS) | `process_audio()` or `processAudio()` |

**Rules:**
- ✅ Clear, descriptive names (no numbers, no cryptic abbreviations)
- ✅ Consistent with existing patterns
- ✅ Self-documenting (name explains purpose)

---

## 🔄 WORKFLOW PATTERNS

### Standard Workflow

1. **Research** - Fully understand context and constraints
2. **Plan** - Draft comprehensive plan identifying risks and edge cases
3. **Implement** - Write clean, efficient, well-tested code
4. **Verify** - Run full test suite and linting
5. **Refine** - Address feedback or failures immediately and thoroughly

### Multi-Agent Patterns

For complex tasks, use multi-agent review:

- **Generator → Reviewer** - Generate code, then review
- **Generator → Security → Reviewer** - Add security review step
- **Reference**: `documentation/workflow-guides/multi-agent-workflow.md`

### Documentation Updates Workflow

When changing structure or adding features:

1. ✅ Update relevant README files
2. ✅ Update `documentation/INDEX.md` if navigation changes
3. ✅ Check and update all cross-references
4. ✅ Verify all links work
5. ✅ Follow existing document templates
6. ✅ Archive old versions (don't delete)
